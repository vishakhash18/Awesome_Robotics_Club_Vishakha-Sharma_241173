I find StepXplorer fascinating because it focuses on creating a robot that can climb stairs, which presents exciting challenges. While building a bot for a uniform track is relatively easy, the real challenge lies in dealing with uneven terrain. Iâ€™m excited to explore the complexities of coding, CAD modeling, and the mechanical principles behind making the robot adapt to different surfaces, ensuring stability, and improving its climbing efficiency. This project offers hands-on experience in solving real-world robotics problems.
